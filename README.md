# Portfolio_Website

This is a portfolio website I made as a project for General Assembly. I made it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Requirements:
This is a pretty simple website that should be compatible with Chrome, firefox, or Opera on either a full-screen browser or mobile device.

Project Notes:
This project is my first public-facing website, and some things were challenging for me. I was not able to get a server ready in time for the contact form, however that will be coming sometime down the line. 

Setup:
There is no setup required, on should be able to simply view on a browser.

Files & Directories:
There is a parent directory called Portfolio_Website which houses two child directories, /image and /resume. It also houses the main script files for the website, index.html , style.css, and app.js.

Hacks:
I employed what is known as the "checkbox hack" to make the hamburger menu. I think this was a very clever solution and I was glad I was able to successfully implement it. 

Design Notes:
I am happy with design at this point in time. I wish I was better at making things sleek, however, I like the way it looks. I chose the color scheme to complement my photos. All photos are my original work with exception to LinkedIn and GitHub logos used with permission.

Credit:
Huge thanks to the team at GA for educating me enough to make something like this and for providing the basis of the section/page format in class. Also big thanks to W3Schools for being a very easy-to-understand resource for novice developers like myself. I learned the checkbox hack from them.
