This is a portfolio website I made as a project for General Assembly. I made it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Requirements:
This is a pretty simple website that should be compatible with Chrome, firefox, or Opera on either a full-screen browser or mobile device.

Technologies Used:
To make this I used HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

Project Notes:
This project is my first public-facing website, and some things were challenging for me. I will improve this as I learn more. It is a one page HTML that contains sections that act as pages so the website only has to load once. All the sections are linked by a collapsible nav styled as a hamburger menu. The sections are Home, About Me, Projects, Contact, Resume, and there are also links to my personal GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

Setup:
There is no setup required, on should be able to simply view on a browser. To install, use the parent folder, everything is linked with that as a referrence. 

User Stories:
  "As a technical recruiter, I want to see the skills and experience of a candidate, so that I can better evaluate what   positions the candidate would be an adequate fit for.

  "As a hiring manager at a large-but-unnamed tech firm, I want to be able to see an applicants relevant work             experience and portfolio at-a-glance, this website accomplishes exactly that."

Files & Directories:
There is a parent directory called Portfolio_Website which houses two child directories, /image and /resume. /image contains all images used, and /resume contains a .pdf resume. Parent also houses the main script files for the website, index.html , style.css, and app.js."

Hacks:
I employed what is known as the "checkbox hack" to make the hamburger menu. I think this was a very clever solution and I was glad I was able to successfully implement it. 

Design Notes:
I am happy with design at this point in time. I wish I was better at making things sleek, however, I like the way it looks. I chose the color scheme to complement my photos. All photos are my original work with exception to LinkedIn and GitHub logos used with permission.

Wireframes:
The final product deviated in some ways from my proposal, however, I believe all of the changes are positive.

Known issues/Room for improvement:
My modals are a kindof clunky solution. This could be a more elegant, dynamic solution instead of hard-coded as it is. At some point I will correct that, but I needed this to just work  by deadline. There are no errors in console. I also was unable to get a server ready for the contact form, that will also be implemented at some point.

Credit:
Huge thanks to the team at GA for educating me enough to make something like this and for providing the basis of the section/page format in class. Also big thanks to W3Schools for being a very easy-to-understand resource for novice developers like myself. I learned the checkbox hack from them.
